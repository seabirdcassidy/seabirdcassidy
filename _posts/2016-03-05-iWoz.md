I just finished reading Steve Wozniak's autobiography, [iWoz: Computer Geek To Cult Icon](https://www.amazon.com/iWoz-Computer-Invented-Personal-Co-Founded
/dp/0393330435). Within it, Wozniak gave a glimpse into his early life and the key experiences that formed his morality, and hashed out some myths about his involvement with Apple from the beginning to 2006 (when this book was written). Though not a very substantial read, I found Wozniak's buoyant personality to be inspiring and good for light, before-bed reading.

An interesting piece of trivia: Steve Jobs met Ron Wayne when they both worked at Atari. Wozniak,Jobs and Wayne formed a partnership to fund manufacturing Apple's first computer. Ron Wayne drew the illustration on Apple's first computer manual. Around the border, the text reads, "A mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought...alone." This is actually borrowed from The Prelude by William Wordsworth. Which in full reads:

> The antechapel where the statue stood<br>
> Of Newton with his prism and silent face,<br>
> The marble index of a mind for ever<br>
> Voyaging through seas of Thought, alone.
