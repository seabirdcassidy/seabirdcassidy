I finished reading [Designing With Web Standards: 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Standards-Jeffrey-Zeldman/dp/0321616952), a classic of the web design industry by Jeffrey Zeldman with Ethan Marcotte. Now I know when to use the DOM and when to use Javascript. When to use DOCTYPE html strict versus transitional versus frameset versus 1.1 versus 5\. How to avoid browser quirks mode. And how to utilize the nature of cascading hierarchies to limit "classitis".

I enjoyed Zeldman's zany humor. For example, while discussing sIFR, which allows designers to replace XHTML text headlines with a font via Javascript, a dry topic, "Almost every good designer I know has implemented sIFR at least once. Almost every man over forty I know has an annual colonoscopy. Those two sentences seem to be related," (p. 290). This one will stay on my bookshelf.
