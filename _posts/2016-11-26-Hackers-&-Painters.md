I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Graham's collection of essays in [Hackers & Painters](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554). I read the book within a couple weeks and mostly while on the bus, which made for some thought-provoking rides.

There's something about Paul Graham's writing that was addictive and inspiring. I feel like I found some of myself in the characters he described - the nerds, craftsman and the makers - and that through them, many of my aspirations and struggles have been encouraged and validated. I closed the book feeling good and like I was on the right path. Graham looks at the world in a different way.
