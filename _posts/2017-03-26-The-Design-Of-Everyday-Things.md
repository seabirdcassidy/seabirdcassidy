This weekend I finished reading Don Norman's classic book, [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=pd_sbs_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0465050654&pd_rd_r=TR3RTN8643X0A1TS7BGN&pd_rd_w=Jq0bo&pd_rd_wg=DQ954&psc=1&refRID=TR3RTN8643X0A1TS7BGN), aka DOET. It truly is a delight to read, though it took me a solid month to complete because I re-read many of the passages to make sure they sunk in.

I particularly enjoyed Norman's explanation of conceptual models. It had never occurred to me that humans base their approaches to new technology on experiences with previous technologies and that poor design is when those conceptual models don't line up with the actual technology. Now I have started noticing mismatched conceptual models everywhere, and have stopped blaming myself when I can't operate the burners on the stove.

Take thermostats for example; many people confuse thermostats with the faucet conceptual model. Turning the thermostat up to 90 degrees doesn't make the room heat faster than turning it to 72 degrees, but many have tried this. Norman says this is not the human user's fault. It's poor design because the turning knob on the wall doesn't provide a more realistic conceptual model. Perhaps the digital panel thermostats do?

This also applies to the designs of 1999 â€“ 2012 era Web 2.0\. Paper-textured backgrounds, comic-ey illustrations and video demonstrations, link hover states, buttons and icons with shadows behind them, word tagging, blogging, commenting, wiki-ing and all their small serif fonts and contrasting garish over-stylized header fonts...It's the knowledge that users brought with them to interact with the new technology, and what was needed for them to make sense of it all.
