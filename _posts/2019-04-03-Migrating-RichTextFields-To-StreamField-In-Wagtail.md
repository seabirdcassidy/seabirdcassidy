title: Migrating RichTextFields to StreamField in Wagtail
description: >-
  How to convert RichTextFields to RichTextBlocks on your Wagtail CMS-powered
  Django blog
---

I recently converted RichTextFields to RichTextBlocks inside StreamFields in a Django blog built with Wagtail CMS.

I wanted to make this change so that I could have more complex content within blog posts. The rich text editor is a nice quick solution to get a blog up and running, but it is also limiting. You can't have links over images, Google Maps, videos with captions, or multi-column layouts. Luckily, that's what StreamFields were designed for. Additionally, I wanted to preserve my already published posts and be able to improve upon them. To do that, I needed to convert them all to StreamFields.

I found the Wagtail documentation to be skimpy, which turned this task into a much longer struggle than it should have been. If you're struggling too, perhaps this tutorial will help you on your mission.

# Migrating RichTextFields to StreamField in Wagtail

## Requirements

I am using Wagtail version 2.1.3 and Django 1.11.

## Models

To start, you should have a `models.py` that looks something like this:

```python

from django.db import models
from wagtail.core import blocks
from wagtail.core.fields import StreamField, RichTextField
rom wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel, StreamFieldPanel


class BlogPost(Page):
  body = RichTextField()

  content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
          FieldPanel('body'))
          ),
      ]
```

Or first step is to convert the `body = RichTextField()` into a StreamField. We also need to change the type of panel that it uses in the Wagtail UI. And so, our `models.py` turns into:

```python

from django.db import models
from wagtail.core import blocks
from wagtail.core.fields import StreamField, RichTextField
rom wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel, StreamFieldPanel


class BlogPost(Page):
  body = StreamField([
  ])

  content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
          StreamFieldPanel('body'))
          ),
      ]
```

Note: we don't actually have to make a migration to change the type of panel. That should update when you refresh your panel. But we'll bundle it into this commit because we can.

## Make Migrations

Next we will make the migrations. In your terminal, navigate to the directory with `manage.py`. We'll enter the command to create a new migration:

```
./manage.py makemigrations --name convert_richtextfield_to_streamfield
```

So then we'll head on over to the migration file generated in your app's /migrations folder. For me, that's blog/migrations and it's called `0020_convert_richtextfield_to_streamfield.py`. This file should look like:

```python

from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import models, migrations
import wagtail.core.blocks
import wagtail.core.fields


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('blogs', '0019_auto_20190402_1126'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='blogpost',
            name='body',
            field=wagtail.core.fields.StreamField([('rich_text', wagtail.core.blocks.RichTextBlock())]),
        ),
    ]
```

We're going to change this up. You'll want to add the RichText import and these additional classes. Also make sure to swap out my app's name for yours:

```python

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Generated by Django 1.11.13 on 2019-04-03 16:48
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import models, migrations
import wagtail.core.blocks
import wagtail.core.fields

from wagtail.core.rich_text import RichText


def convert_to_streamfield(apps, schema_editor):
    BlogPage = apps.get_model("blog", "BlogPost")
    for page in BlogPage.objects.all():
        if page.body.raw_text and not page.body:
            page.body = [('rich_text', RichText(page.body.raw_text))]
            page.save()


def convert_to_richtext(apps, schema_editor):
    BlogPage = apps.get_model("blog", "BlogPost")
    for page in BlogPage.objects.all():
        if page.body.raw_text is None:
            raw_text = ''.join([
                child.value.source for child in page.body
                if child.block_type == 'rich_text'
            ])
            page.body = raw_text
            page.save()


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        # don't change this, Django knows what it's doing
        ('blogs', '0019_auto_20190402_1126'),
    ]

    operations = [
        # leave this AlterField in place
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name='blogpost',
            name='body',
            field=wagtail.core.fields.StreamField([('rich_text', wagtail.core.blocks.RichTextBlock())]),
        ),
        migrations.RunPython(
            convert_to_streamfield,
            convert_to_richtext,
        ),
    ]
```

Note: you can also check out [Wagtail's official documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.1.3/topics/streamfield.html) on this topic to see where the inspiration for this code came from.

## Migrate

Finally, we're going to migrate. Back in your terminal, enter `./manage.py migrate`. You'll then want to restart the Django server. When you return to your Wagtail admin panel you'll notice that every previously published post's RichTextField has been converted to a StreamField RichTextBlock. Tada!
