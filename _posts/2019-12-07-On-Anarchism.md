[On Anarchism](https://smile.amazon.com/Anarchism-Noam-Chomsky/dp/1595589104/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3OWUQBGZ5B75W&dchild=1&keywords=on+anarchism+noam+chomsky&qid=1592790489&s=books&sprefix=on+anarch%2Caps%2C187&sr=1-2) was the first time that I dipped my toes into some of Noam Chomsky's writing. It caught my eye because of its attractive, graphic cover. This book was difficult to decipher at times, though I did find value in pushing myself to finish it.

This book is a collection of essays and interviews, rather than one cohesive piece of thought. I think that is part of the difficulty in deciphering. Each dialogue exchange takes time to put in context. Chomsky's natural style is slow building, meandering, and requires frequent supplemental Wikipedia reading to grasp his references. I enjoyed his more casual dialogues the most. I felt they were more accessible and linear, when the interviewer controlled the progression.

Some excerpts from pages I marked:

> Anarchy as a social philosophy has never meant "chaos" - in fact, anarchists have typically believed in a highly organized society, just one that's organized democratically from below.

> Anarchism has always been regards as the ultimate evil by people with power.

> INTERVIEWER: But if we ever had a society with no wage incentive and no authority, where would the drive come from to advance and grow?<br>
> CHOMSKY: Well, the drive to "advance" - I think you have to ask exactly what that means. If you mean a drive to produce more, well, who wants it? Is that necessarily the right thing to do? It's not obvious. In fact, in many areas it's probably the wrong thing to do - maybe it's a good thing that there wouldn't be the same drive to produce. People have to be driven to have certain wants in our system - why? Why not leave them alone so they can just be happy, do other things?

> ...that's one of the main purposes of socialism, I think: to reach a point where people have the opportunity to decide freely for themselves what their needs are, and not just have the "choices" forced on them by some arbitrary system of power.

I have since listened to quite a few of Chomsky's talks on YouTube. I get a different result listening to him speak. His speaking presence is more engaging, even hypnotic, and more emotionally impactful to me. I much prefer to watch and listen to Noam Chomsky. Regardless, this book was still worth reading. He is one of the sharpest minds of our time and I love his dissection of questions.
