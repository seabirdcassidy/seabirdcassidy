The [Tao Te Ching](https://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Laozi/dp/0060812451/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=tao+te+ching&qid=1591827236&sr=8-7) is a book that I keep returning to, especially in times where I feel like I've wondered off the path. Its very short verses are easily digestible, and though poetic, don't hide a lot of meaning. The Tao Te Ching's lessons serve as gentle reminders to let go, be compassionate, give in to serendipity, let yourself and others self-govern. Though Taoism has influenced many schools of thought, notably Zen Buddhism, you could also say that the Tao holds the precursor to anarchism. There is quite a bit of guidance in the way of "hands-off" government and leadership that makes me think of a utopia where individuals follow the Tao and need no ruling.

# On Translations

Stephen Mitchell's version was good, but I am curious to read other translations. I chose this version first because it was highly recommended. But some of the complaints that I have heard are that it goes beyond translation to "modern interpretation" of the original text. I am curious about the nuances that might have been in the original text and lost by Mitchell's modernization.

I think the lessons contained within Taoism merit more time and contemplation. I will be adding more translations of Tao Te Ching to my reading list. In particular, I added the translated copies from Thomas Cleary, Arthur Waley, Robert Henricks, John C.H. Wu, and D.C. Lau to my list. I suppose the next best thing would be to learn Classical Chinese and try to find a scan of the original document, if such a thing exists in the public sphere. The beautiful thing about this book is that it is very small and concise, which is probably why it's been published in more than 200 different translations.

# The Way

One of my favorite excerpts:

> We shape clay into a pot,<br>
> but it is the emptiness inside<br>
> that holds whatever we want.

The Beatles were influenced by the Tao Te Ching too. This particular verse is strikingly similar to "The Inner Light" written by George Harrison in March 1968\. It was released as a non-album single as the B-side to "Lady Madonna".

> Without opening your door,<br>
> you can open your heart to the world.<br>
> Without looking out your window,<br>
> you can see the essence of the Tao.<br>

> The more you know,<br>
> the less you understand.<br>

> The Master arrives without leaving,<br>
> sees the light without looking,<br>
> achieves without doing a thing.<br>

Many of the verses focus around the nature of life, which we humans perceive as full of contradictions, unpredictability, and chaos. Part of the human struggle is the fight against nature, an outlook that we must organize and tame it to achieve what we want. But the Tao is like a hidden order, giving meanings to circumstances that are revealed when we stop wanting and engage in non-action.
