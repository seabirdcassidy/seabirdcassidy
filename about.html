  <p>Hello! Curious to learn more about me and this website?</p>

  <p>
    I spend my time these days as a self-employed computer programmer. I enjoy having the liberty to tunnel
    into my interests and choose tools that work well for me. I am curious about too many subjects to choose
    only one for eight hours a day. I feel most energized when I'm learning something new. I want to spend my
    time deeply understanding things.
  </p>

  <p>
    I find most corporate environments very stifling, hence my move towards self-employment. I am open to
    contract work if the project is interesting to me and I see it benefitting the world.

    The current version of this website was designed to showcase my book reviews and long-form writing.
    I was heavily inspired by Swiss Style grids and International Orange. I built this website
    with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby static site generator, and
    <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, a CSS preprocessor. This website also uses
    <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> for data visualizations.
    It is all neatly hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

  <h3>Who's the seabird?</h3>

  <p>The handle "seabirdcassidy" is a reference to one of my favorite songs, "Cassidy", written by John Barlow and Bob Weir of
    the Grateful Dead. It's a song that I enjoy, not just because of the title, but because of its
    rolling, bursting with life, upward musical progression. It starts mellow and ends up whirling off, like a
    bird taking flight. I believe it encompasses a sense of letting go into renewal.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream.<br />
        I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream.<br />
        Ah, child of countless trees.<br />
        Ah, child of boundless seas.<br />
        What you are, what you're meant to be<br />
        Speaks his name, though you were born to me,<br />
        Born to me, Cassidy...<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac.<br />
        I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back.<br />
        Come wash the nighttime clean,<br />
        Come grow this scorched ground green,<br />
        Blow the horn, tap the tambourine<br />
        Close the gap of the dark years in between<br />
        You and me, Cassidy...<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Quick beats in an icy heart.<br />
        catch-colt draws a coffin cart.<br />
        There he goes now, here she starts:<br />
        Hear her cry.<br />
        Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words<br />
        Wheel to the storm and fly.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Faring thee well now.<br />
        Let your life proceed by its own design.<br />
        Nothing to tell now.<br />
        Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine.<br />
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      The lyrics "fare thee well" were also used for the name of the last concert tour of the surviving members. Fare Thee Well:
      Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead gathered an immense amount of interest. Ticket demand broke the records at Ticketmaster
      and created absolute mayhem in the secondary ticket market scene. I remember single tickets selling anywhere between $2000 to
      $15,000, depending on the view of the stage, though tickets dropped as low as $20 days before the shows. With luck,
      perserverence, and little miracles, my boyfriend and I managed to see each show of the tour. Probably one of the best two weeks of my life!

    <p>Bob Weir even <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-weir-reveals-what-grateful-dead-song-to-play-at-his-funeral-68494/">said himself</a> that
      of all the Grateful Dead songs, he wants "Cassidy" played at his memorial service.</p>
